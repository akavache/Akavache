            Ignore me. This class is a secret handshake between RxUI and RxUI.Xaml
            in order to register certain classes on startup that would be difficult
            to register otherwise.

            This control hosts the View associated with a Router, and will display
            the View and wire up the ViewModel whenever a new ViewModel is
            navigated to. Put this control as the only control in your Window.

            This content control will automatically load the View associated with
            the ViewModel property and display it. This control is very useful
            inside a DataTemplate to display the View associated with a ViewModel.
