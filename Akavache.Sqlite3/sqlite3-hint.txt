READ ME, THIS ISN'T A LICENCE, IMMA HELP YOU OUT

Akavache.SQLite3 depends on a native sqlite3.dll being present. How you do that depends on what platform you're on:

WPF / Desktop:
1. Copy sqlite3.dll from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html into bin/Debug
2. Make sure your project is set to x86, not AnyCPU

WP8 / WinRT:
1. Download the Extension VSIX from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html
2. Follow http://is.gd/LFKkEb to set it up (works on both WP8 and WinRT)
